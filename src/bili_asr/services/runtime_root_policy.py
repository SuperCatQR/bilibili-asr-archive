"""Explicit policy for product-owned runtime directories at archive roots.

Runtime coordination leaves a small amount of filesystem state behind after a
worker exits.  Maintenance must account for that state explicitly: stopped
fence lock files are safe to exclude, while active or malformed state remains a
hard failure.  This module is intentionally independent of the database so all
maintenance entry points can apply the same rule.
