"""Kernel-owned object fences and shared local-space reservations.

Locks outlive an execution lease. They are released by the owning process or
the kernel on process exit, never by guessing whether a PID or timer is stale.
Persistent observations can be retired only while holding the corresponding
exclusive kernel fence. Manual pins are never retired here.
