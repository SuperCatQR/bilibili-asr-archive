"""Choose a transcript version and shape its publication record.

This module is pure: it opens no connection and writes no file. The workflow
runtime reads stored versions, chooses one candidate per part, and publishes
the selected body through the archive writer. Publication paths and transcript
identity are then recorded in SQLite.

The order is contract §3.2's, applied in order: the kind rank (an uploader
caption before a machine caption), the language **family** rank (``zh``, then
``en``, then every other family), the language code ascending, and the version
**descending**.  It is total because the store's
``UNIQUE (video_part_id, source_kind, language, version)``
(``schema-transcripts.sql:25``) makes ``(source_kind, language)`` an identity and
``version`` unique inside it, so keys 1–4 separate every row a shipped writer can
store and this module adds no ``transcript_id`` tiebreak.  Two consequences are
deliberate rather than accidental: a part holding both an uploader caption and a
machine caption publishes the uploader one, and a part holding ``ai-zh`` and
``ai-en`` publishes the Chinese one — the family rank is what stops the code
order from preferring English there.

Language-family normalization and version preference live in the pure
``transcript_selection`` module. Producers, consumers and storage planners
share those rules without importing acquisition or persistence implementations.

The shared rules that are imported keep one home each:
:func:`~bili_asr.formatting.duration_s_from_ms` for the milliseconds-to-seconds
conversion, and
:func:`~bili_asr.page_identity.format_work_id` for the row's identity (§2.1,
where the read deliberately leaves ``work_id`` to Python).
