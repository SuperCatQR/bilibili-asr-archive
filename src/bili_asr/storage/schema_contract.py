    SQLite keeps the original text of a view's ``SELECT`` but drops the trailing

    one are never byte-equal even when the view is current.  Whitespace and case
    are collapsed as well, which makes the comparison a statement about the body
    rather than about formatting.

    Two properties are load-bearing and were each measured:

    * comments are stripped from **both** sides.  SQLite *preserves* a comment
      that sits inside a view statement, and every shipped view carries several
      (4 to 24 lines each), so stripping only the shipped body would make every
      view read as stale on every open.
    * whitespace and case are collapsed **outside string literals only**.  A body
      differing from the shipped one only inside a literal — ``'no-subtitle'``
      against ``'NO-SUBTITLE'`` — must still read as different, or a genuinely
      stale view would never refresh.
