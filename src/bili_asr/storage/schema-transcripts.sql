-- Transcript and acquisition process-record contract.
--
-- Applied by ``initialize_schema`` only to a database that is fresh
-- (``transcripts`` absent) or already carries this contract; a database
-- created before it keeps the shape it has, because ``CREATE TABLE IF NOT
-- EXISTS`` cannot widen an existing unique constraint.  The archive database
-- is rebuildable for contracts that require changed identity constraints.
-- Credential verification is an additive exception: initialization adds its
-- column with default 0, preserving historical evidence as unverified.
-- Foreign-key enforcement is a connection property
-- owned by ``initialize_schema`` (``PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON``, verified),
-- so this script declares no pragma of its own.

-- 2) missing_audio: in the subtitle gap and the caption route is exhausted with
-- no audio evidence yet.  Exhaustion is attested, not inferred from one look.
-- The newest subtitle attempt admits the part only when it is ``'no-subtitle'``
-- with a verified listing ``'not_found'`` or corroborated empty inventories.
-- Historical ``not_found`` also covered authentication/body failures, so its
-- code alone proves nothing: per-attempt ``absence_verified = 1`` is required.
-- A ``'failed'`` attempt establishes no subtitle absence: authentication,
-- transport, rate-limit and malformed-response failures stay on the retry route.
-- An *indefinite* ``'no-subtitle'`` — ``error_code IS NULL``, i.e. the
-- inventory was empty but this credential may simply not have seen it — admits
-- only once two **independent** observations exist, where independent means a
-- distinct credentialed ``run_id``. Anonymous observations cannot establish
-- exhaustion: those parts stay off the paid branch until authenticated harvests
-- have actually seen the empty inventory.  In the query below, "credentialed"
-- means ``credential_present = 1`` AND per-attempt ``credential_verified = 1``.
-- Cookie presence alone cannot prove an authenticated observation. These
-- predicates are load-bearing alongside
-- ``COUNT(DISTINCT run_id)``: two probes
-- inside one run are ONE observation, so a retry loop cannot inflate the count.
-- (The table's PRIMARY KEY is ``(run_id, video_part_id)``, which makes a second
-- row for one part in one run unwritable in the first place; changing that key
-- would weaken this, so treat it as a review trigger.)
-- Measured 2026-10-03: a single empty inventory became a durable verdict and put
-- a part that did have subtitles into the paid branch; a genuinely caption-less
-- control part reports empty on every run, so it still reaches this queue — one
-- observation later than under the one-look predicate.
-- Audio evidence is a ``part_audio_objects`` row and nothing
-- else: an ``acquisition_attempts`` row under a ``kind = 'audio'`` run can only
-- ever record a *failed* download, since the attempt contract admits
-- ``stored`` / ``unchanged`` only with a ``transcript_id`` an audio acquisition
-- never produces.  Probing attempts here would invert the signal — a part with
-- audio on disk would be excluded while a part that failed to download would
-- enter the transcription queue — so this view does not.  Newest-attempt idiom
-- copied from ``v_pending_subtitles``.
