    Commit boundaries per public method:

    - ``start_acquisition_run`` commits its own insert so a part that fails
      later can roll back without losing the run parent.
    - ``finish_acquisition_run`` commits its own terminal transition.
    - ``record_acquired_transcript`` owns one transaction: it validates the
      part and the arguments, computes the content hash, appends a version with
      its segments only when the content is new, writes the attempt row with
      the resulting ``'stored'``/``'unchanged'`` outcome, and commits — or
      rolls back wholly, so a version is never stored without the attempt
      evidence that produced it.
    - ``record_subtitle_attempt`` owns one transaction for one ``'no-subtitle'``
      or ``'failed'`` attempt and commits it.
    - ``read_transcript``, ``list_transcript_versions``,
      ``list_pending_subtitle_parts``, ``count_pending_subtitle_parts``,
      ``list_selected_parts``, ``list_stored_transcripts`` and
      ``read_video_pubdates`` — the class's reads of the ``videos`` table, which
      :class:`MetadataRepository` owns — never write and never commit: they
      return the stored rows as they are — a typed ``TranscriptRecord`` for one
      stored version, ``sqlite3.Row`` view data otherwise.

    Versions are immutable: no method rewrites or deletes a transcript row, a
    segment row, or an attempt row, and no method recomputes the outcome of a
    run that already finished.  Attempt evidence is append-only per
    ``(run_id, video_part_id)`` and is never a terminal per-part state, so a
    part recorded without a caption stays re-attemptable in a later run.

    Do not compose ``start_acquisition_run``, ``finish_acquisition_run``,
    ``record_acquired_transcript`` or ``record_subtitle_attempt`` inside a
    :meth:`MetadataRepository.transaction` group: each commits independently
    and would commit the enclosing group's earlier writes.

    The connection must come with ``row_factory = sqlite3.Row`` and
    ``PRAGMA foreign_keys`` enabled — exactly the state :func:`open_database`
    establishes — and must carry the transcript-schema contract: the
    constructor rejects anything else, so a caller that skipped
    :func:`require_subtitle_schema` still meets the bounded rebuild error
    instead of a raw ``sqlite3.OperationalError`` from its first query.
