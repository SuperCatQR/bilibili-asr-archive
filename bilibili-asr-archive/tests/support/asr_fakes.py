"""Test doubles for the ASR boundary's model seam.

The boundary talks to exactly four objects — an ASR processor and model, an aligner processor and
model — plus the audio reader.  Every suite that drives the ASR path through the CLI gets those
without a GPU or a checkpoint: the model factory is replaced here, and ``tests/conftest.py``'s
``mock_torch`` supplies the tensor surface.  The audio reader is **not** replaced — it is exercised
for real, so the light members of the ASR stack (``numpy``/``soundfile``/``soxr``) are declared as
test dependencies rather than stubbed.  The heavy three (``transformers``/``accelerate``/``torch``)
stay optional.

Usage:

    fakes = install(monkeypatch)          # factory + audio read/write patched
    assert main(["asr", "--pending", ...]) == 0
    assert fakes.constructions            # what the runner built, in order

``install`` returns the :class:`ModelSet` it hands the runner, so a test can assert on what the
processor was asked to transcribe (``fakes.processor.audio``) or on the text it produced.
