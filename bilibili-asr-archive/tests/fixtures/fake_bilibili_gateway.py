"""The single deterministic offline fake for the Bilibili package seam.

Every package-seam test scripts these fakes instead of touching the pinned
``bilibili-api-python`` distribution or the network:

- ``FakeGateway`` is the plain ``BilibiliGateway`` protocol double used by
  the ingestor and CLI tests: scripted pages, parts, summary completions and
  per-part subtitle listings/bodies with recorded fetch calls, plus the
  credential the composition root handed the double; unexpected fetches fail
  loudly instead of returning script-free data.
- ``FakeUpstreamScript`` / ``build_fake_package`` / ``bilibili_api_seam``
  install the fake ``bilibili_api`` package on ``sys.modules`` for the real
  adapter tests.  The fake mirrors only the documented import surface the
  adapter may use (``Credential``, ``request_settings.set_proxy`` /
  ``get_proxy``, the ``user`` and ``video`` endpoint descriptions and the
  ``access_id`` route, the WBI-signed ``utils.network.Api`` every documented
  request is issued through, ``video.Video.get_info`` / ``get_pages``, and the
  exceptions taxonomy) and exposes no subtitle, playback, audio, or download
  *method* on those classes, so a silent switch to another package API fails
  loudly instead of silently succeeding.  ``applied_proxies`` records every
  proxy the adapter hands to the package settings, so its apply-once behavior
  is asserted without a network call.
- ``FakeApiRequest`` with ``script.api_requests`` records every request the
  adapter issues through the package's ``Api``, in issue order: the transport
  flags it took from the package endpoint description (device-fingerprint
  ``dm`` overridden), the ``raw`` request argument, whether the credential it
  carried held a SESSDATA value, and the exact parameters it handed over, so
  the risk-control-relevant and credential-boundary call shapes are assertable
  without a network call.  ``script.access_id_calls`` records the separate
  ``access_id`` token route (kept out of ``calls``: it is a memoized,
  best-effort token fetch, not a metadata call).
- ``script.player_response`` / ``script.player_error`` script the player call
  (``video.API["info"]["get_player_info"]``, whose unwrapped payload carries
  the subtitle inventory) and ``script.subtitle_bodies`` scripts the signed
  subtitle documents by URL: a plain document, a ``BaseException`` to raise,
  or a callable receiving the fetched URL.  An unscripted document URL fails
  loudly, so an adapter that fetches somewhere it did not mean to is caught.
- ``script_parts_by_bvid`` scripts one parts payload per requested ``bvid``
  for seam tests that collect a page holding several distinct videos.
- ``DOCUMENTED_METADATA_CALLS`` with ``assert_only_documented_metadata_calls``
  pins the upstream call names the gateway may issue.
- ``NO_LEAK_MARKERS`` with ``assert_leaks_no_markers`` holds the
  realistic-looking secret and raw-payload sentinel texts (a SESSDATA
  value, a signed playback URL, the signed subtitle-document URL in both the
  absolute and the protocol-relative form upstream answers, a raw JSON
  response body, and raw upstream exception text) plus the scanner behind the
  no-secret assertions, and ``persisted_row_text`` renders persisted rows for
  those assertions.
