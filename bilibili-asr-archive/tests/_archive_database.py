"""Seed ``archive.db`` for the CLI fixtures whose rows live in the manifest.

``archive.db`` is the sole queue input since the ``--queue-source`` cutover:
``download-audio`` / ``asr`` / ``pilot`` / ``run --scope pending`` read the store
gap views, and ``services/queue_source.py`` answers a root with no database by
returning ``None`` — the command then prints its own ``no archive database``
line and exits 1 at its precondition.  A fixture that seeds only
``ManifestStore`` therefore cannot drive those commands at all.

This module is the one place that bridges the two stores for a test: it reads
the manifest rows a fixture already wrote and records the equivalent store
facts, through the repositories' own writers (the same discipline
``tests/test_cli_queue_source.py`` states for its fixture), so the queue views
answer with the parts the manifest names.

Usage, from a fixture that has just written its manifest rows::

    from _archive_database import _seed_archive_database

    _seed_archive_database(root)

What it records per manifest row, keyed on the row's own ``status``:

- every row with a resolvable ``(bvid, page_index, cid)`` becomes a
  ``videos`` / ``video_parts`` pair (``processing_status`` follows the row: a
  ``gone`` row is stored ``gone``, so the gap views' own filter applies), and
  the part is selectable at all;
- a row whose declared ``audio_path`` exists on disk gets its ``audio_objects``
  / ``part_audio_objects`` evidence — the sole positive audio probe (§4d) — and
  therefore sits in ``v_missing_transcript`` (the ASR queue);
- a row that neither holds a caption nor has audio bytes on disk gets the
  ``no-subtitle`` attempt ``v_missing_audio`` requires, which is what puts a
  captionless part in the download queue;
- a row already holding a caption (``subtitle_done`` / ``archived``) gets the
  store-side caption the row asserts: one stored transcript under a subtitle
  source kind, so the part leaves ``v_missing_subtitle`` and the store stops
  claiming the caption route is still owed.  ``v_missing_subtitle``'s predicate
  is *no stored transcript*, so without this write a caption-holding row is
  selected as harvest-needed (status ``meta_ok``) and the command re-probes a
  caption route that already succeeded — the drift that made the scheduler
  fixtures red after the queue-source cutover.  It gets **no** ``no-subtitle``
  attempt history: a fabricated one would claim the caption route was tried
  and came back empty, which is the reverse of what the row says.

The ``no-subtitle`` attempt is recorded for ``meta_ok`` rows as well: several
fixtures harvest the row to ``needs_audio`` *after* seeding, and the store has
to describe the part the command will actually meet.  A ``meta_ok`` row is in
``v_missing_subtitle`` either way, so its harvest queue membership is unchanged.

Deliberately minimal (YAGNI): the caption record is one transcript with one
segment — enough to satisfy the gap views' *has-a-transcript* predicates — and
the attempt history is at most the one ``no-subtitle`` fact the audio queue's
own predicate reads.  What this mapping cannot bridge: a caption the store
holds still needs a stored transcript to be visible, and the stored caption's
*content* is not derived from the fixture's raw subtitle document.
