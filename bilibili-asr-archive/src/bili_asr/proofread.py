"""``bili-asr proofread`` — the merge-v2 proofread method as a package module.

Two routes into one side-by-side table; no route is ground truth.

* Blocks are built from **ASR VAD segments only**: a new block starts when the
  next segment's ``start_ms`` exceeds the current block's ``end_ms`` by more
  than :data:`BLOCK_GAP_MS`.  Subtitles never define block boundaries — the
  2026-09-22 wave's 22.8% drift came from letting caption cues split blocks.
* A block's *target span* runs from its first segment's start to the first gap
  after it: either the next block's first segment start, or the last segment's
  end.  Caption entries attach to exactly one block by interval overlap
  (largest first, tie broken by earliest start).  An entry overlapping no
  target span is *unassigned* — a counted route disagreement, never dropped
  silently: 2026-09-22 showed the true gap count is ~0, and every unattached
  bucket in that wave was a counting artifact, not a fact.
* Similarity between the block's ASR text and the concatenation of its caption
  entries is ``difflib.SequenceMatcher(autojunk=False)`` — the autojunk default
  was a documented 2026-09-18 trap that under-reports common-character
  similarity.  ≥0.85 agree / 0.75–0.85 minor / <0.75 review.

Merge markers (the contract ``proofread-merge`` parses) live at the end of a
block heading line, after ``>>``:

* ``>> keep`` — accept the 字幕 column (default for every unmarked block);
* ``>> use-asr`` — accept the ASR column;
* ``>> use-sub`` — accept the 字幕 column, spelled out;
* ``>> custom: <text>`` — replace the block with the payload text.

The marker payload is plain text on the heading line: it survives any markdown
viewer and diffs as a one-line change.

Count-guards (the 2026-09-22 lessons, Task 2 of plan 20260928-proofread-pipeline):

* Guard A — coverage: every subtitle entry and every ASR character appears in
  exactly one block (:func:`guard_a_coverage`); a violation raises
  :class:`GuardViolationError` naming the block.
* Guard B — no fabrication: the banned cue-centering criterion (the one that
  fabricated 23–27% false gaps on 2026-09-22) must not exist.  It is banned
  *in code*: the module never computes a cue center, and
  ``tests/test_proofread.py``
  (``test_guard_b_banned_criterion_absent``) greps this source for
  the banned tokens and fails if they return.
* Guard C — stability: re-running on the same inputs is byte-identical
  (deterministic ordering throughout; no wall clock, no randomness).
