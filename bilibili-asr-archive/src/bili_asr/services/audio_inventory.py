"""Reconcile the audio store with what the archive actually holds.

The two tables ``audio_objects`` / ``part_audio_objects`` are written as audio is
acquired (``MediaQueueRepository.mark_audio_acquired``); nothing could *read*
them back as an inventory.  :func:`reconcile_audio_inventory` is that read.

The four counters are **product rulings**, not naming choices — they are defined
in ``specs/audio-retention-contract.md`` §3.1, and the plan that owns this module
says to implement them as written rather than redefining one locally.  They are
reproduced here so a reader of the code does not have to hold the spec open:

``recorded``
    A manifest candidate that had **no** ``audio_objects`` row and now has one.
    Never invented when the file was absent.
``already``
    A candidate whose object row was already present **and matched**.  A re-run
    converges; it does not accumulate, and never writes a second row for one
    ``sha256``.
``missing``
    A manifest row that **names** an ``audio_path`` and the file is not there —
    the shipped reclaim path and a manual delete both produce it.  Never deleted,
    never re-created, never silently skipped.
``unlinked``
    An observed audio object that **no** ``part_audio_objects`` row attributes to
    a part.  The store can see the object but cannot tie it to a work.

**The command is additive and read-only over the audio tree.**  No counter
authorises a write to the filesystem: this module reads bytes to digest a file
and it never unlinks, re-creates or moves one.

**This module does not print.**  It is a service: it returns an outcome and names
the rows it could not read in that outcome, and ``cli.py`` decides what an
operator sees.  (It was the only module under ``services/`` that printed, which
put an operator-facing message in a layer that cannot know the command's name.)

Digesting is **not** optional.  ``audio_objects.sha256`` is ``NOT NULL UNIQUE``
(``schema.sql:94``), so a row without one is a row the store cannot deduplicate,
and ``mark_audio_acquired`` refuses a bare hash outright.  The single streamed
pass below is therefore the same read the size probe already pays for.  ``--deep``
is not a "hash or don't" switch; it *re-verifies* the digest of an object whose
row is already present.

**"Matched" is checked by size, not by reading.**  §3.1 says ``already`` counts a
row that was "already present **and matched**", so a presence-only check would
assert something it did not check.  Comparing digests would mean reading every
known file on every run and would break the published cost model, so the check is
``os.stat().st_size`` against the stored ``byte_size`` — a stat, not a read, so
"zero file reads for a known row" stays true.  ``--deep`` is what escalates that
to a digest comparison.

    The **manifest is the candidate set** — this function never enumerates a
    directory to decide what should exist.  The filesystem is consulted for one
    question only: "is the file this row names actually there?".  A directory
    scan would invent candidates the archive never declared, which is precisely
    what ``missing`` is forbidden to do.

    ``known_objects`` maps ``audio_objects.storage_key`` to its stored
    ``(byte_size, sha256)`` — the size is what makes §3.1's "and matched"
    checkable without reading bytes, and the digest is what ``--deep`` compares a
    fresh read against.  ``known_audio_ids`` is the ``audio_objects.audio_id``
    set and ``linked_audio_ids`` the ``part_audio_objects.audio_id`` set.

    ``part_durations`` maps a manifest ``work_id`` to the store's own
    ``video_parts.duration_ms``.  It comes from the **store**, not from the
    manifest row: the manifest carries whole seconds (``duration_s``) because its
    writers floor and clamp them, so reconstructing milliseconds from it loses
    the exact value (``1234567 ms → 1234 s → 1234000 ms``).  A work id absent from
    the mapping records ``0``, which the schema defines as "unknown".

    ``record`` is ``MediaQueueRepository.mark_audio_acquired``, called with
    keyword arguments — this module does not open a transaction of its own, so the
    store keeps owning its writes.
