"""Where the pipeline's products live: one configured root, two ordered read bases.

The pipeline's **products** — audio, transcript bundles, harvested subtitle documents —
may live under a root that is not the archive root (``--artifact-root`` /
``BILI_ARTIFACT_ROOT``); its **state** (``manifest/``, ``archive.db``,
``coordinator/``, the sidecars) always stays at the archive root.  This module is the
single place that resolves, validates and carries that split
(``artifact-root-contract.md`` §2–§5, decisions D7–D12).

Resolution (contract §3.2, D9)::

    --artifact-root <value>   (non-blank)  -> use it
    else BILI_ARTIFACT_ROOT   (non-blank)  -> use it
    else                                   -> the archive root (today's behaviour)

A blank or whitespace-only value at either level counts as *unset* and never blocks the
next level, which is :func:`config.resolve_proxy`'s idiom (``config.py:154-175``) and
deliberately not :func:`config.resolve_sessdata`'s (``config.py:128-141``): the
credential's blank-blocks-fallthrough rule exists because it has a security-relevant
anonymous mode, and a path has no such mode.  ``~`` is expanded **here and nowhere
else**: :func:`resolve_artifact_root` is the only expander, so :meth:`ArtifactRoots.of`
is abspath-only for both roots and a ``~``-bearing archive root keeps exactly the
treatment ``archive._lexical_archive_root`` (``archive.py:264-265``) and
``ManifestStore.root`` (``manifest.py:101-107``) give it today.  A relative value is
made absolute against the process CWD exactly as ``--archive-root`` behaves today.
The path is kept **lexical** — ``realpath`` is never applied — because
``path_policy.open_audio_directory`` (``path_policy.py:32-57``) opens the root itself
with ``O_NOFOLLOW``: resolving first would silently follow a symlinked root past that
check.  The consequence is stated for the operator: a symlinked artifact root is
refused, so pass the real path.

Validation (contract §3.3, D10) happens once, in :func:`roots_for`, and only for a
**configured** root.  A value lexically equal to the archive root is the **identity
case**: one base, today's code path, not validated further, because an explicit no-op
must be a no-op.  Any other value must already be an existing, **non-symlink**
directory this process can actually open, or the command refuses with its usage/config
exit and names the path.  Artifact writers additionally create, write, sync and remove
a temporary probe here; readers do not require a writable product root.  Directory
sync is probed on POSIX, matching the descriptor-based publishers; Windows publishers
use file sync without a directory-descriptor primitive.  The symlink refusal is
explicit and comes first: ``is_dir()``
follows a link, so without it
a symlinked root would be accepted here and only fail later — every write raising a raw
``OSError`` from ``O_NOFOLLOW``, every read silently degrading to the archive root.  A
missing root is **never created**: an unmounted mount point still exists as an empty
directory, and auto-creating a missing one would publish products to the underlying
filesystem instead of the mount.  A root *inside* the archive root is accepted — a
legitimate layout, and the two bases stay distinct.

Reads (contract §5, D7/D8) never see an absolute recorded path.  The recorded strings
stay artifact-root-relative (``audio/{stem}.m4a``, ``transcripts/{stem}/bundle.srt``), so
the manifest's bytes are unchanged by this feature and no reader needs to know which
root a row was written under.  :func:`resolve_audio_path` walks
:meth:`ArtifactRoots.read_bases` in order and returns the first hit, with each
candidate validated at **its own** base by that family's existing guard — never a
cross-root path computation.  A legacy row written before the root was configured
therefore keeps resolving to its existing file (§5, D6), and nothing durable records
the root (D12): a later run with a different root neither rewrites nor invalidates
earlier rows.

That loop is a **read** rule, and it is a genuine ordered probe only in its default
mode: with ``require_exists=False`` the first base whose ``audio/`` directory opens wins
whether or not the file is there, so base 2 is reached only when base 1 has no ``audio/``
at all and the returned path may not exist.  **Writes must not use it.**  Every artifact
write, and every write-side re-confinement (``audio.download_audio``'s ``audio.py:151``),
resolves on :attr:`ArtifactRoots.write_base` alone — one base, chosen by where the write
goes rather than by which directory happens to exist.

Layering: a shared policy leaf beside ``path_policy``, importing stdlib plus
``path_policy`` only — never a manifest, storage or artifact writer — so the
cross-layer rule that only ``cli`` composes the stages is not widened.
