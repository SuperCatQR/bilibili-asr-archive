# --- sys.path preamble -------------------------------------------------------
# The test interpreter is intentionally NOT the pip-installed artifact (see
# tests/installed_cli.py for the console-script lane): the suite loads the
# source tree via sys.path. These are the only two inserts in the suite — one
# per path, declared once here; do not re-add ad-hoc ``sys.path.insert`` calls
# in individual test modules.
#
# The package sources live in ``src/``:
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "..", "src")))
# ``scripts/`` (verify_baseline, check_asr_env, ...) is an importable namespace
# package rooted at the repo; without the repo root on ``sys.path`` the two test
# modules that import it fail collection with ``ModuleNotFoundError: No module
# named 'scripts'``. The repo root also makes the ``tests/`` directory itself
# importable, so sibling test modules can be imported by name.

# so the *next* red is diagnosable instead of merely counted.
